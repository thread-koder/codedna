# CodeDNA Specification

## Overview

CodeDNA is a tool that understands and maintains the unique characteristics of your project while helping it evolve in a healthy way.

## Current Status

This is a proposal document outlining the vision and technical approach for CodeDNA. The implementation phases are planned but not yet started.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Project DNA

- Architecture patterns (how the project is structured)
- Code patterns (how code is written and organized)
- Team patterns (how the team works together)
- Security patterns (how security is implemented)
- Feature patterns (how features are developed)
- DevOps patterns (how infrastructure is managed)

### 2. Pattern Recognition

- Structural patterns (how code is organized)
- Behavioral patterns (how code behaves)
- Review patterns (how code is reviewed)
- Success patterns (what makes patterns successful)

### 3. Evolution Tracking

- Change history (what has changed)
- Success rates (what works well)
- Team adaptation (how the team evolves)
- Architecture evolution (how the structure evolves)
- Security evolution (how security improves)
- DevOps evolution (how infrastructure evolves)

### 4. Analysis Tools

- Code review (analyzing changes)
- Technical debt (identifying issues)
- Performance (measuring impact)
- Pattern consistency (ensuring alignment)
- Security analysis (checking vulnerabilities)
- DevOps analysis (optimizing infrastructure)

## Implementation Phases
