# CodeDNA Examples

CodeDNA adapts its analysis to your project's specific characteristics. These examples show how it works with different types of projects, from simple frontend applications to complex microservices architectures. The tool automatically detects your project's patterns, tools, and practices to provide relevant insights.

> **Note**: These examples show potential outputs of what CodeDNA might produce. The actual implementation will determine the real outputs, patterns, and metrics based on your project's specific characteristics and the analysis performed by the tool.
